# Garbage Collection

We say an object is garbage when it can be safely collected, without interfering with the program flow.
We usually collect objects that are either not reachable or that aren't referenced by other objects anymore.
There are plenty of ways to implement a garbage collection system.

## Garbage Collection in Lua

Lua implements garbage collection with the following considerations in mind [(1)]:

* If an object is not accessible from the root set (registry and shared metatables), it can be collected
* Finalizers are implemented by the `__gc` metamethod.
	* An object is marked for finalization when a metatable with a finalizer is set to it
	* Objects marked for finalization and then finalized, cannot be finalized again (even after ressurecting [(2)])
* Only after Lua 5.2, tables can be finalized. Until then, only userdata could be finalized.
	* Lua 5.1 offers a built-in `newproxy` function for creating new userdata in pure Lua.
* Weak references are cleared before and after object finalization

## Lua references in Python

The way Lupa holds references to Lua objects is through the functions from the auxiliary library: `luaL_ref` and `luaL_unref`.
These functions create and remove entries from a table containing the object on top of the stack.
`luaL_ref` returns an integer corresponding to the key used to index the table for later unreferencing.
`luaL_unref`, in the other hand, receives such integer for removing the entry in the table.
The table of choice is the registry table, which is a quite common option for this usage.
The integer used as key in this table is stored in the `_LuaObject` class. When this object is collected, the reference is freed.

## Garbage Collection in Python

Python implements an *optional* garbage collection (see the `gc` module [(3)]).
It traverses objects that contain the `Py_TPFLAGS_HAVE_GC` flag. By contract, they should also implement the `tp_traverse` and `tp_clear` callbacks
in order to detect reference cycles and break them.

In reality, Python's primary memory management strategy is reference counting, which, in turn, cannot be turned off.
Each and every Python object contains a reference counter. When this reference counter reaches zero, it is immediately finallized and deleted.
Finalizers in Python are implemented by the `tp_finalize` callback, or, in pure Python, by the `__del__` method.
Since these callbacks can contain arbitrary code, they provide a chance of ressurecting the object, by incrementing the reference count
(e.g. storing it in a global variable or in a "live" data structure).

## Python references in Lua

In order to keep track of how many objects in Lua are referencing a Python object, the `LuaRuntime` class contains a dictionary called
`_pyrefs_in_lua` which contains for every object a counter for the number of references to that Python object in Lua.
References to Python objects in Lua are implemented with a userdata which implements several metamethods.
When this userdata is created, the reference counter to the object is incremented. And when it is garbage collected, it is decremented.

# Cyclic references

Take the following example of a Lua script

```lua
local python = require 'lupafromlua'
local diff = collectgarbage('count')
do
	local t = {}
	local d = python.builtins.dict()
	t.ref = d
	d.ref = t
end
collectgarbage('collect')
collectgarbage('collect')
diff = collectgarbage('count') - diff
assert(diff == 0)
```

The assertion at the end will fail, because there is a cyclic reference that is not currently resolved.
Basically, the table is being referenced by a `_LuaObject` instance, which is being referenced by the dictionary,
which is being referenced by the userdata, which is being referenced by the table.

Lua cannot inspect the userdata dependencies, because it is a black box. Python can't visualize the whole cycle for the same reason.
This cycle is only broken when the `LuaRuntime` instance is collected by Python, which, in turn, deallocates its `_pyrefs_in_lua` dictionary
containing all Python objects being referenced from Lua. That is, all cycles persisist until the end of the program.
By then, an arbitrary number of cycles can be formed and leaked.

## Attempt

Roberto suggested the following strategy:
Instead of storing a strong reference to a Lua object in the registry, we should it in a weak table in the registry.
Take the following Lua code as an example.

```lua
-- Creates a weak table in the LUAREFSINPY registry key
function new_weakt()
	local weakt = {}
	setmetatable(weakt, {__mode = "v"})
	debug.getregistry().LUAREFSINPY = weakt
end
```

This table would contain tables containing the referenced object in Lua and a userdata with finalizer.
Every time the userdata is finalized, a new table in the same index is created, with a new userdata and the same Lua object.
Take the following Lua code as an example.

```lua
-- Creates a reference to a Lua object
-- Uses Lua 5.1 newproxy built-in function
-- But for Lua >= 5.2, tables could be used
function new_reference(obj)
	local weakt = debug.getregistry().LUAREFSINPY
	local ud = newproxy(true)
	getmetatable(ud).__gc = function(old_ud)
		local ref = getmetatable(old_ud).__ref
		if weakt[ref] == nil then
			weakt[ref] = { obj = obj, ud = newproxy(old_ud) }
		end
	end
	local ref = #weakt + 1
	getmetatable(ud).__ref = ref
	weakt[ref] = { obj = obj, ud = ud }
	return ref
end
```

We want to be able to detect the cycle demonstrated previously.
If an object in Lua is collected, it means that it is not reachable by the root set.
If an userdata pointing to a Python object is collected, then it is too not reachable by the root set.
If an object in Python got collected because no more userdata points to it, then it is not reachable by any of both languages.
If a `_LuaObject` in Python is collected, then it is not reachable in Python.
If so, it means that the reference should be released.
But differently from removing the reference in the table, a sentinel value is set in the same index of the weak table.
This way, we can be sure that a cyclic reference might be formed and that it should not persist. That's why we check if
`weakt[ref] == nil`. If the entry in the weak table was collected, it would be `nil`. But if a sentinel value was inserted instead,
it would be different than `nil`, so it would not recreate the entry in the weak table.

There is, though, a flaw in this algorithm. To visualize it better, let's imagine that the `_LuaObject` was still being referenced
by another object in Python (that is not referenced in Lua). That means that all of the objects between the `_LuaObject` and the
object referenced in Python would be collected, but not the `_LuaObject`. That's where the flaw is at. Since Python uses reference
counting as its main memory management strategy, objects that reach a reference count of zero are immediately collected and *cannot*
be ressurected. For some types of objects, that leads to files being closed, connections being terminated, etc.

There is too a key difference in the order of actions taken by the garbage collection systems. Lua first marks all the reachable
objects in the graph and then finalizes all the unmarked objects. But in Python, objects are finalized as they are terminated, more
like a chain reaction than a graph traversal (that's more like the `gc` module's task). That means that if we were to store all the
Python objects referenced in Lua to be finalized, we would be effectively preventing objects to be finalized, because we would be
keeping at least one reference to it alive. In other words, we cannot know beforehand the aftereffects of finalizing an object
in Python or all the objects that will be finalized.
