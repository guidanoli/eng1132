# Garbage Collection

We say an object is garbage when it can be safely collected, without interfering with the program flow.
We usually collect objects that are either not reachable or that aren't referenced by other objects anymore.
There are plenty of ways to implement a garbage collection system.

## Garbage Collection in Lua

Lua implements garbage collection with the following considerations in mind [(1)]:

* If an object is not accessible from the root set (registry and shared metatables), it can be collected
* Finalizers are implemented by the `__gc` metamethod.
	* An object is marked for finalization when a metatable with a finalizer is set to it
	* Objects marked for finalization and then finalized, cannot be finalized again (even after ressurecting [(2)])
* Only after Lua 5.2, tables can be finalized. Until then, only userdata could be finalized.
	* Lua 5.1 offers a built-in `newproxy` function for creating new userdata in pure Lua.
* Weak references are cleared before and after object finalization

## Lua references in Python

The way Lupa holds references to Lua objects is through the functions from the auxiliary library: `luaL_ref` and `luaL_unref`.
These functions create and remove entries from a table containing the object on top of the stack.
`luaL_ref` returns an integer corresponding to the key used to index the table for later unreferencing.
`luaL_unref`, in the other hand, receives such integer for removing the entry in the table.
The table of choice is the registry table, which is a quite common option for this usage.
The integer used as key in this table is stored in the `_LuaObject` class. When this object is collected, the reference is freed.

## Garbage Collection in Python

Python implements an *optional* garbage collection (see the `gc` module [(3)]).
It traverses objects that contain the `Py_TPFLAGS_HAVE_GC` flag. By contract, they should also implement the `tp_traverse` and `tp_clear` callbacks
in order to detect reference cycles and break them.

In reality, Python's primary memory management strategy is reference counting, which, in turn, cannot be turned off.
Each and every Python object contains a reference counter. When this reference counter reaches zero, it is immediately finallized and deleted.
Finalizers in Python are implemented by the `tp_finalize` callback, or, in pure Python, by the `__del__` method.
Since these callbacks can contain arbitrary code, they provide a chance of ressurecting the object, by incrementing the reference count
(e.g. storing it in a global variable or in a "live" data structure).

## Python references in Lua

In order to keep track of how many objects in Lua are referencing a Python object, the `LuaRuntime` class contains a dictionary called
`_pyrefs_in_lua` which contains for every object a counter for the number of references to that Python object in Lua.
References to Python objects in Lua are implemented with a userdata which implements several metamethods.
When this userdata is created, the reference counter to the object is incremented. And when it is garbage collected, it is decremented.

# Cyclic references

Take the following example of a Lua script

```lua
local python = require 'lupafromlua'
local diff = collectgarbage('count')
do
	local t = {}
	local d = python.builtins.dict()
	t.ref = d
	d.ref = t
end
collectgarbage('collect')
collectgarbage('collect')
diff = collectgarbage('count') - diff
assert(diff == 0)
```

The assertion at the end will fail, because there is a cyclic reference that is not currently resolved.
Basically, the table is being referenced by a `_LuaObject` instance, which is being referenced by the dictionary,
which is being referenced by the userdata, which is being referenced by the table.

Lua cannot inspect the userdata dependencies, because it is a black box. Python can't visualize the whole cycle for the same reason.
This cycle is only broken when the `LuaRuntime` instance is collected by Python, which, in turn, deallocates its `_pyrefs_in_lua` dictionary
containing all Python objects being referenced from Lua. That is, all cycles persisist until the end of the program.
By then, an arbitrary number of cycles can be formed and leaked.
