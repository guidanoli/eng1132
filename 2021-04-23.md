## How does Lupa manage calls from Python and Lua? (1p2)

When a Lua object is called in Python, its triggers its `__call__` method, which only accepts positional arguments,
since keyword arguments are not supported in Lua. Each argument is then converted and pushed onto the Lua stack.
A specific error handler is also pushed onto the stack to allow a stack traceback to be generated on errors.
The call is executed in protected mode and the return values are converted back to Python and returned back to `__call__`.

For calling Python objects in Lua, the `__call` metamethod is triggered. The userdatum and arguments in the stack are
converted to Python objects and the call is executed in a try-except block in case any Python exception is raised.
Although it may seem similar to the previous case, calling Python objects in Lua exposes some interesting differences between the two languages.

* Python methods are bound to objects, while Lua methods aren't.
* Python function calls accept keyword arguments, while Lua functions don't.

First, we need to address the problem with Python methods.
In simple terms, we would like to translate the following Lua code:

```lua
pyobj:method(...)  -- which is pyobj.method(pyobj, ...)
```

... into the following Python code:

```python
pyobj.method(...)  # which is type(pyobj).method(pyobj, ...)
```

We then need to check if `pyobj` and the first argument are equal and if the method is bound to `pyobj`.
In that case, we simply convert the method into a function (thus, making it not bound anymore).

We also need to find a way to call Python objects with keyword arguments in Lua.
The solution we came up with envolves allowing the user to construct a userdatum containing positional and keyword arguments
which would be "unpacked" if passed to a Python object call. The function that allows constructing this object takes a
Lua table as argument, employing the following heuristic.

* The sequential part of the Lua table (where the keys are integers from 1 to the length of the table) maps to the positional arguments in Python
* The record-like part of the Lua table (where keys are strings) maps to keyword arguments in Python
* Any key that does not fit in any of the previous two criterium is invalid (unpacking would raise an error)

An interesting consequence of this heuristic is that non-sequential integer keys are considered invalid. For example

```lua
python.builtins.print(1, 2, python.args{3, 4, sep=','})          -- 1, 2, 3, 4
python.builtins.print(1, 2, python.args{3, 4, sep=',', [7] = 5}) -- index error
```

Moreover, these argument objects can be combined within the same call to allow the following use case.

```lua
A = python.args{5, 7, end=''}
B = python.args{11, sep=', '}
C = python.args{9}

python.builtins.print(A, B) -- 5, 7, 11
python.builtins.print(B, C) -- 11, 9
```

See https://github.com/scoder/lupa/pull/177 for the development of this feature.

## How does Lupa take advantage of Python and Lua dynamic natures? (1p4)

One of the main aspects agreed upon by both languages is that functions are first-class citizens.
Ergo, they behave like any other object. In fact, in both languages, objects other than functions
can be called. In Lua, this is done by defining a `__call` metamethod, while in Python, an object
can be called if it contains the `tp_call` slot.

Not only is it easy to construct function objects, but calling them with any number of arguments
of any type is equally possible. We're going to discuss how this is implemented in the API of
both languages.

Python defines a set of C API functions for calling objects with no arguments, with one argument,
with a tuple of arguments, and with a tuple and a dictionary of arguments. These tuples and dictionaries
need to be constructed and populated beforehand. These functions return the Python object returned
by the call, which can be a tuple of objects.

On the contrast, Lua keeps its minimalist philosophy with an orthogonal approach to function calls.
First the object to be called is pushed onto the stack, and then the arguments. A call to the Lua
C API `lua_pcall` (or `lua_call`) pops all of these objects from the stack and executes the call,
which returns either a fixed number or a variable number of arguments in the stack.

Also, accessing and updating object attributes is also possible to do at runtime.
The Python C API defines plenty of functions for handling object attributes, which is handled by
the `tp_setattr`, `tp_setattro`, `tp_getattr`, `tp_getattro` slots.
And the Lua C API defines also a set of functions for handling indexation, which is handled by
the `__index` and `__newindex` metamethods.

For memory management, Python makes it more explicit by defining a set of API calls for reference counting.
While in Lua, the garbage collector takes care of this so the developer does not need to rely
so heavily on the API. This is in part due to the fact the Lua always holds ownership of its objects,
so it does not need to worry about external references to objects, while Python allows for the explicit
handling of objects as regular C structures. This makes writing C code for Python more susceptible
to incorrect handling of objects (in particular, their reference counts), compared to Lua.

## Why are most scripting languages C APIs? (1p5)

The C language is very popular amongst the low-level programming languages, which is very much desirable for
scripting languages to be built upon. Not only that, this allows for C extension modules to interface with
already existing C/C++ libraries. Furthermore, the vast majority of operating systems are written in C, so
explicit system calls are effectively cheaper if done in C. This includes the dynamic loading of libraries,
a feature well known and used by extensible scripting languages such as Python and Lua. Another good reason
to chose C as a base language is it widespread support on a vast range of platforms, which is specifically
optimal for the usage of Lua in embedded systems.

## Why is Lupa implemented in Cython?

With Cython, it is easier to write somewhat version-agnostic code for Python extension modules.
But sometimes the incompatibility is so great that it must be explicitly handled (as with Python 2 versus Python 3).
Also, Cython code is much more maintainable than pure C code because it is more concise and abstracts the C API.
Still, you can call C API functions if you really need to.
Because the compiler is good at generating efficient C code, it can often lead to performance gains over writing pure C code.
Another big advantage of writing in Cython is that you don't have to worry about the burden of reference counting for Python objects.
It automatically generates calls to the C API functions related to reference counting where necessary. This can be turned of by typing objects with `PyObject*` instead of `object`.

## Compare how embeddable and extensibile Python and Lua are. (2p5)

It can be seen for several aspects that Python is not optimized for being embedded in applications.
For instance, because the Python environment is structured in modules in order to avoids namespace conflicts,
storing variables in a global scope is harder than in Lua, since there is no single global scope. (5p2-3)
Furthermore, evaluating expressions through the Python C API requires defining a global and a local scope,
while in Lua you can evaluate expressions from strings and files anywhere in the code, which makes it prefferable
for embedding. One can say that Lua is prefferable for embedded systems for its smaller footprint, compared to Python.
Also, for machines with less computing power, Lua generally outruns Python in benchmarks. (needs source)

On the other hand, many of the cited aspects about Python can be seen as strengths, rather than weaknesses.
Having the environment structured in modules helps ever-growing software to take shape and extend the already
rich feature set of the Python standard library. Moreover, Python has built-in functionalities for installing,
setting up and testing extensions. It goes without saying that the standardization of these processes aids the
integration of libraries and other ressources.

As for Lua, there is no standardized form for sharing libraries, although LuaRocks is a well known (unofficial)
Lua package manager. Nevertheless, the Lua API is as optimal for embedding as for extending,
since it is orthogonal to its use. There are no specific core API functions for registering modules because
they are generally just tables with functions. Apart from elegant, the minimalist nature of Lua is also
responsible for making its API symmetrical from both the host program and the add-on module points of view.

## How memory management differ from Python and Lua? (3p2)

Python defines two types of memory management: reference counting and garbage collection.

Reference counting works by defining a reference count for each Python object.
When this reference count is zeroed, the object is immediately finalized.
This type of memory management is considered the "poor man's memory management" because it gives little information about the reference graph.
The reference count is a escalar and cannot tell which objects it references or whom it is referenced by.
This leads to reference cycles, which cannot be resolved solely with reference counts.
This type of memory management cannot be turned off.

In order to resolve reference cycles in Python, the language supports garbage collection as an auxiliary memory management system.
The garbage collector traverses every accessible Python object that defines the `tp_traverse` slot and finalizes the unreached objects.
This complements reference counting nicely because it resolves cyclic references.

Lua, in the other hand, opts for a more simplistic approach, which is by means of garbage collection alone.
It is defended that reference count adds overhead even if a program never allocates memory.

The garbage collector implementation has changed throughout the evolution of Lua.
Notwithstanding, it holds more or less the same principles about its behaviour.

* Only objects from the root set are preserved (registry and shared metatables)
* The collector operates on top of standard allocation functions
* All objects are linked in a long list

Weak references are handled with extra care during the atomic step, since after collection, finalizers might have populated new items in them,
so they need to be cleared a second time. A novelty of the Lua garbage collector is the ressurection of objects in the atomic step.
Objects are ressurected when finalized, for example, if stored elsewhere upon finalization.
When objects are to be finalized, they are marked so that their finalizers are called only once.

(Could we traverse `_LuaObject` in order to resolve the cyclic reference problem?)

## How data are transfered between Python and Lua? (3.1p1-2)

### Parameters

Lua function calls only accept positional arguments, while Python accepts keyword arguments too.
Therefore, we need to find a way to represent Python keyword arguments when calling Python objects in Lua.
Lupa defined a decorator to wrap Python funcitons and methods so that Lua tables would be unpacked into positional and keyword arguments.

This solution had several issues if applied to the usage of Lupa in Lua:

* Python methods when wrapped would not be bound to the instance objects anymore
* Calling Python objects with tables can have different outcomes whether they are decorated or not, which promotes programming error

The solution we came up with was to create an opaque object containing positional and keyword arguments constructible from Lua.
This opaque object is recognized in Python object calls in Lua and reinterpreted to concatenate positional arguments and merge keyword arguments.

### Object attributes

Python offers two types of indexation: attribute and item indexation.
The attribute of an object is access with a dot (`.`) and is meant for metadata and metamethods.
On the other hand, items are accessed with brackets (`[...]`) and is meant for accesing items from mapping and sequence objects.

Lua, on the contrary, offers a single type of indexation, originally for tables.
The indexation operator (`.` and `[...]`) can, nevertheless, be extended to other Lua objects with the `__index` and `__newindex` metamethods.

The problem arises when trying to alternate between index protocols of Python objects in Lua.
The heuristic implemented in Lupa in order to decide which protocol to use by default is the following:

* If the object has a `__getitem__` attribute, item indexation is assumed by default.
* Else, attribute indexation is assumed by default.

This heuristic fails on mapping and sequence objects, which, by definition, contain attributes (ergo, the `__getitem` attribute).
The solution to this problem is to allow the user to explicitly wrap Python objects in Lua to force a certain indexation protocol to be used.
Thus, the `as_attrgetter` and `as_itemgetter` are defined in the Lua module.
These functions set a flag on the Python object wrapper which is checked on the `__index` and `__newindex` metamethod calls.

### Converting or wrapping objects (3.1p2)

#### Integer overflow handling

Throughout the evolution of Python and Lua, several changes were made relating to integers.

In Python 2, there were two types of integers: fixed (`int`) and arbitrary (`long`) precision integers.
While Python `int` was limited to the precision of the C type `long` (`LONG_MIN` and `LONG_MAX` in `limits.h`),
Python `long` could hold an integer limited only by the user virtual memory space.

With the introduction of Python 3, all integers had arbitrary precision and had the type `int`.
This, of course, created incompatibilities with Python 2, specifically in the C API.
`PyInt` functions were removed, leaving `PyLong` functions to deal with the `int` type.

In Lua prior to version 5.3, all numbers (`lua_Number`) were represented by a floating-point type (`float` or `double`, depending on configuration).
Nevertheless, the C API exposed functions for pushing and converting integer values (`lua_Integer`) to/from the Lua stack, as long as convertible to numbers (`lua_Number`).

From version 5.3 on, the number type uses two internal representations: `integer` and `float`.
The Lua `float` subtype is mapped to the C `lua_Number` type, and the Lua `int` subtype is mapped to the C `lua_Integer`.
The difference is that, instead of requiring the integer to be convertible to floating-point representation, it is stored as is.
Along with this change, `math.type` was introduced to differentiate between the two subtypes, `math.maxinteger` and `math.mininteger` exposed the representation limits for Lua integers, and `math.tointeger` allowed converting of floats to integers.

Several issues arise when converting Lua numbers to Python integers and vice versa.

The first issue to be addressed is the different underlying C types for Python 2 and Lua 5.3 fixed-precision integer.
While Python 2 fixed-precision integer is of C `long` type (which takes 4 bytes on Windows and UNIX 32-bits and 8 bytes on UNIX 64-bits), Lua integer is of C `ptrdiff_t` type (which takes 4 bytes on 32-bit machines and 8 bytes on 64-bit machines).
Since the size of `ptrdiff_t` is larger or equal to the size of `long`, Python fixed-precision integers always fit Lua fixed-precision integers.
The opposite is true for Windows 64-bit machines, for instance. The solution is to convert a Lua fixed-precision integer to a Python arbitrary-precision integer.

The second issue occurrs when converting Python arbitrary-precision integer too large to fit in a Lua fixed-precision integer.
While some users might tolerate lost of numerical precision, most mathematical applications wouldn't.
In order to give the user full control of overflow errors, the solution was to allow the user to register overflow handlers from both sides of the interface.
This handler is called when converting a Python integer to a Lua integer would lead to lost of numerical precision.
It should return a well-behaved Python object, such as a cast to a Python float, or raise an error if the error could be handled.
If the handler raises an error, an `OverflowError` is raised with an appropriate error message.

A third issue is converting Lua numbers to Python numbers.
For versions of Lua later than 5.3, this is trivial.
For older versions, it has to be checked whether the Lua `lua_Number` can be converted to a `lua_Integer`.
If so, it is converted to a Python integer. If not, it is converted to a Python float.

Extra care is given for Python 2 fixed-precision integers:
if a Lua integer fits in a C `long` type, it is converted to Python 2 `int`.
Else, it is converted to a Python 2 `long`.
In Python 3, since there is no distinction, it is always converted to an arbitrary-precision integer.

#### `nil` and `python.none`

Both Lua and Python have their own null objects.

In Python, it is `None`, which is the default return value of functions. Its type is the `NoneType`.

In Lua, it is `nil`, which is the default value for missing table entries and padding function arguments. Its type is also `nil`.

In both languages, it is commonly used for "no value" or "missing value".
Specifically, they are different from any other value. Yet, each has its own peculiarities.

In Lua, since variables are indexed in tables, any unset variable is `nil`.
Tables cannot be indexed with `nil` (or `NaN`).
Also, iterations in for-loops stop when `nil` is returned. Remember this.

On the other hand, referencing uninitialized variables in Python will raise a `NameError`.
Mappings (like dictionaries) can have both keys and values as `None`.
Generators and iterables can yield `None` too.

It is clear that they have their differences, specially on iterations.
That's why they aren't a 1:1 map. But since it seems that `nil` has more uniqueness,
or in the sense that `None` behaves not much differently from other objects, it seems
fair to sometimes wrap Python `None` to Lua, rather the inverse.

Lupa defines `python.none` as a wrapper around `None`.
It is particularly for two purposes:
* when iterating through Python objects in Lua, since Python `None` does not halt an iteration, while `nil` does.
* when setting/deleting an entry in/from a Lua Table in Python (if the key is `None`, it needs to be wrapped to `python.none`).

#### String encoding

(Look into it)

#### Opaque object types

When we can't convert objects from one language into the other, we resort to the most orthogonal solution possible: wrapping them in opaque object types.

Lua has the perfect type for this purpose: `userdata`. While Lua is not aware of the contents of this memory space, it allows for customizable behaviour by means of metamethods. Python objects in Lua are represented by userdata that contain:
* a borrowed reference to the Python object (`PyObject*`)
* a borrowed reference to the `LuaRuntime` instance (`PyObject*`)
* a bitmap with flags related to the behaviour of the wrapped object (`int`)

Whenever a Python object is wrapped, it is cached in a dictionary inside `LuaRuntime` and in weak table in Lua, to avoid multiple copies of the same Python object in Lua. This way, whenever a `userdata` is garbage collected, by means of the `gc` metamethod, it is released from the cache inside `LuaRuntime`.

Other metamethods defined for this userdata include `index`, `newindex`, `tostring` and `call`.

Meanwhile in Python, we define types for each Lua object type, with few to no public attributes. Similarly to Lua, we are able to define special attributes for enhanced behaviour of these types. All Lua objects in Python are represented by a `_LuaObject` instance that contains:
* an owned reference to the Lua object (`int`) - see `luaL_ref` and `luaL_unref`
* an owned reference to the `LuaRuntime` instance
* the Lua state (`lua_State*`)

Whenever a Lua object is wrapped, a reference to it is added in the registry.

**Note:** This clearly shows the difference between the two APIs: While Python allows us to manipulate object pointers as we wish, Lua never exposes pointers and internal structures of its objects. Instead, we take ownership by storing it somewhere safe (e.g. the registry).

When a `_LuaObject` instance is finalized, the object is unreferenced.

Other metamethods defined for this type include `call`, `len`, `nonzero`, `iter`, `repr`, `str`, `getattr`, `getitem`. The higher number of metamethods, compared to Lua, might come from the fact it Lupa is meant for Python usage, but also because of Python design (`repr` and `str` map to `tostring`, `nonzero` is not need in Lua, `iter` is done by `python.iter` instead).

#### Large strings should be wrapped?

(Look into it)

## How are concurrent threads handled in Lupa? (3.1p3, 5p13)

(Look into coroutines)

## Discuss the reference cycle problem.

**Brief:**

One language can't see the full picture.
This is resolved when one of the languages is finalized first.
If the host is Python, Lua is finalized first (and vice versa).

## How is the Python interpreter initialized and finalized when Lupa is loaded from Lua? (2.3p2)

**Brief:**

When Lupa is loaded from Lua, the Python interpreter is initialized (`Py_InitializeEx`) and dynamically opened if on Linux (`dlopen`).
A table is registered in the registry to be collected when the Lua state is closed.
This table has a `gc` metamethod that finalizes the Python interpreter and closes the library if it was dynamically opened.

## How is the Lua state initialized and finalized when Lupa is loaded from Python? (2.3p2)

**Brief:**

When a `LuaRuntime` instance is constructed, a Lua state is created.
Its `__dealloc__` method then closes the Lua state.

## Why would a Lua developer want to have an interface with Python? (4p2)

**Brief:**

"Python has a more complete feature set than Lua" (excerpt from the article)

It is a fact that Python has a much richer standard library.
Therefore, it can serve then as an "all-in-one" solution for a vast range of problems.

## How do Lua and Python distinct C API natures influence the code for Lupa? (4.1p1-2)

While Python always signalizes errors with return values of function calls, Lua errors are implemented as long jumps.
When an error is raised in a protected context, Lua redirects the program flow to an established "check point" (see `lua_pcall`).
On the other hand, calling Lua API functions in an unprotected environment causes Lua to panic (see `lua_atpanic`).
This creates a major problem for Lupa, because in both cases, long jumps would kill the reference counting of Python objects.
Altough Cython manages reference counting automatically, it never expects program flow to be redirected non-locally.
Hence, in order to tell Cython not to interact with the Python C API in specific functions, we use the `nogil` attribute.
We then call these C functions in protected mode with `lua_pcall`.

(Give as examples `lua_gettable` and `lua_objlen` for Lua 5.1 or `luaL_len` for Lua > 5.1)

We also need to guarantee the consistency of the Lua stack when Python exceptions are raised.
In Python, the `try-except` construct is used to properly handle exceptions.
When an exception is raised inside a `try` block, the program flow is redirected to the appropriate `except` block.
Furthermore, a `finally` block can be added to be executed at the end whether an exception is raised or not.
So, in order to "restore" the Lua context when a Python exception is raised,
we store the stack top before entering the `try` block (`lua_gettop`), and reset it in the `finally` block (`lua_settop`).

## How well documented are the Python and Lua and their respective APIs?  (5p7)

Both languages and their APIs are relly well documented.
Not only that, the source code of both languages are very much readable.

## Where does Lupa come from? (5p13)

It is a partial rewrite from Lunatic Python, a project by Gustavo Niemeyer.
It has been inactive for quite a long time (for more than 13 years).
It is incompatible with current versions of Python and Lua for that reason.
Lunatic Python had also other forks too, such as one by [bastibe](https://github.com/bastibe/lunatic-python).
Lupa is very distinct because it is implemented in Cython and can only be loaded as a Python extension module.
It has added plenty of features not present in the original project, such as support for coroutines, and extensive unit tests.
It is maintained by Stefan Behnel, one of the main maintainers of Cython too.
This choice of language is really optimal since Python is not really meant for embedding.
Also, it is hard to implement such a big extension module with its ever-changing C API.
To solve this issue, Cython adds an abstraction layer so that the developer can write Python-like code.
It can, of course, make calls to Python C API functions if they really need to.
